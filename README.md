Shape Escape is a bullet hell available on Windows in its current release. It takes place in a world in which shapes come to life and a strange power has started to disrupt the order of the world itself. Cigil, our protagonist, is on a jounery to navigate the uproar and come out on top. We consider the version being submitted now to be a prototype that we plan to continue to develop after this class. It only contains the circle and triangle areas. We hope you enjoy our prototype game that we are proud to present, and we look forward to the  finished version that will be publish on itch.io! Further developements will be announced in the discord soon.
